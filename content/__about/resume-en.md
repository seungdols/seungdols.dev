# 🙌 Hi,

<div align="center">

I'm SeungHo Choi but I use `seungdols` of nick-name. I love that study language, framework, and then programming. I like `Java`, `JavaScript`, `Ruby`, `Python` `Kotlin` etc.

Nowadays, I interested in `Go` language and `k8s` (container), IaC(Infrastructure as Code), `ansible`, `unit test`, `documentation`.
One more thing, I love happy hour other developers.
